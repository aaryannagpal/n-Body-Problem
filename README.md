# Nemesis, the Evil Star

According to one theory, our Sun was not formed alone 4.5 billion years ago. Some believe our Sun has a twin named Nemesis, a brown dwarf star. Because it is Brown dwarf, it is difficult to identify and has yet to be identified. 

Nemesis is believed to be in orbit in the Milky way that brings it close to the Sun every 26 million years. This coincides with roughly mass extinctions that have happened over the last 500 million years.

## Simulating it
To disprove this theory, let us assume we discover the unfortunate presence of Nemesis at the periphery of the theorized Oort Cloud, slowly approaching
towards us.

The faint red dot is the hypothesised Nemesis brown dwarf. It is expected to be 1.5 Light Years (or 95,000 AU) away from the Sun and is believed to be
reason of very elongated paths of some TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects) and the ’sling-shotting’ interstellar objects towards the solar system.
