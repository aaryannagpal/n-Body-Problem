13.8 billion years ago, since the Big Bang, the universe has been the totality of existence, containing the entirety of space and time, as well as their contents. Within these contents, exist four fundamental forces, being **Weak Nuclear force**, **Strong Nuclear force**,**Electromagnetic force** and **Gravitational force.**

Every physical phenomenon we observe, from a sub-atomic to a universal scale, is all the result of the interaction of these four fundamental forces with matter, at different scales, at different intensities. The most abundant of these forces is the **Gravitational force**. Gravitational force (or gravity) is the attraction between two objects with mass or energy. Gravity is responsible for objects falling towards the surface, the tides caused by the orbiting of moon around the Earth, and even holding the solar system and galaxies together.

Just like any other force, the gravitational force acting on each object changes as new objects with mass and energy enter its range. This is the result of vector addition of gravitational force and to compute and calculate the motion of objects under the influence of each otherâ€™s gravity is known as the ***n-body problem***.

# N-Body problem
The n-body problem in physics is the problem of predicting the individual motions of a set of astronomical objects interacting gravitationally with each other. First posed by Sir Issac Newton, this problem specializes in the motion of objects due to the gravitational interaction between them. This problem, with combination with general relativity, has been instrumental in predicting the interactions of many astronomical structures.

The n-body problem considers n point masses *m<sub>i</sub>, i = 1, 2, . . . , n* in an inertial reference frame in three dimensional space R3 moving under the influence of mutual gravitational attraction. The general formula for this problem is
